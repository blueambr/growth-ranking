# Growth Ranking of U.S. States

## How to run

1. `npm i`
2. `npm start` for web, `npm test` for tests

## Description

This is a small application, which fetches the U.S. States data, updates it with a YOY growth rate and presents it in a simple grid. It lets user choose which particular data and period they would like to see and includes a small testing suite.

What I did here:

-   Created the application logic
-   Created tests
-   Switched `node-sass` for `sass` (Dart Sass)
-   Created styles for the results/States list/grid

What I did not do:

-   Create the architecture/structure and working evironment
-   Choose technologies
-   Divide anything into modules and components (didn't seem necessary here)
-   Update anything (packages etc.)
